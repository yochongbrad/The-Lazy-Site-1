                            Turn the TV on, 
                            throw my hand in my pants. 
                            Nobody's gon' tell me I can't.
                            I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie. 
                            Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie. 
                            'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man.
